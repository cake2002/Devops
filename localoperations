Local Operations:

The git branch command does more than just create and delete branches. If you run it with no arguments, you get a simple listing of your current branches.

Rename the branch locally with the git branch --move   

Rename your local master branch into main with the following command:
$ git branch --move master main

After youâ€™ve done all these tasks, and are certain the main branch performs just as the master branch, you can delete the master branch:
$ git push origin --delete master
